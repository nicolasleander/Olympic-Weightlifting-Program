# Olympic Weightlifting Program

This 12-week Olympic weightlifting program is designed to enhance strength, power, and technical proficiency in athletes preparing for competition. The regimen is structured into three main phases: the preparatory phase, competition phase, and tapering phase leading up to a competition day. Each phase strategically builds upon the last, increasing in intensity and complexity while focusing on key lifts: the snatch, clean & jerk, and their variations.

## Program Overview

### Weeks 1-7: Preparatory Phase

Focuses on building foundational strength and refining technique. Exercises include variations of snatches, cleans, jerks, squats, and auxiliary work such as pulls and presses.

### Weeks 8-11: Competition Phase

Shifts towards maximizing power output and efficiency in the classical lifts. Training includes more specific work on the snatch and clean & jerk, with adjustments in intensity to stimulate peak performance.

### Week 12: Tapering and Competition

Reduces volume to ensure athletes are rested, while maintaining intensity to keep performance levels high. The week concludes with a competition day, where athletes execute their lifts in a simulated or actual competitive environment.
